Sample login/webpage using HTML, PHP, MYSQL


Used PhPMyAdmin as localhotst for SQL sever, connections and databases.
Created webpage page - if the user enter his correct username and password, it will redirect to the second 'welcome'page.
If the username entered is correct but typed wrong password a pop up will show up as 'data mismatch'.
if the both credentials are wrong it will show as 'data not found'.
